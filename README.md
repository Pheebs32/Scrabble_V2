# Scrabble

---
This is my second attempt at a Scrabble game project in Java.
<br>I believe my first attempt was too much all at once for such a new language, and so I am restarting with a simpler approach.
#### Motivation
I am making a Scrabble Board game in each language I know to show progression through the language.
<br>This will continue as I learn new languages as well - hopefully.
#### Design/ Classes
The board will be made up of a 15 X 15 array of Cell objects.
<br> It will show bonuses that the cells have (eg, starting centre, double letter/ word and triple letter/ word)
<br> It will connect all the tiles to one another by their own pointers.
